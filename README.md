#  Read Me

The project was created as a code challenge/sample which required loading data from a text file, displaying the data in a table, and showing a chart in the detail view. Optionally it could include use of a singleton, a background process, and some unit tests (I wrote a few). It was coded in about 8 hours.

Project requirement:
1. Carthage should be installed (/usr/local/bin/carthage)
